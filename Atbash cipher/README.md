# Atbash cipher

The Atbash cipher is a substitution encryption algorithm.

Each letter is replaced by the corresponding symmetric in the alphabet.

Let's see an example.

If I take the string 'ab' I get 'zy'.

For simplicity we choose the international alphabet composed of 26 lowercase characters.
