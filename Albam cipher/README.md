# Albam cipher

The Albam cipher is a substitution encryption algorithm.

Each letter is replaced with the one corresponding to 13 successive or previous positions.

The alphabet is divided into two sets and each letter is replaced with the respective one from the other set.

Let's see an example.

If I take the string 'ab' I get 'no'.

Conversely, if I take the string 'no' I get 'ab'.

For simplicity we choose the international alphabet composed of 26 lowercase characters.
