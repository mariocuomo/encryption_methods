# Polybius square

The Polybius chessboard is an encryption algorithm that converts characters into numbers.
Each letter is replaced with the corresponding coordinate in the following chessboard

  1 2 3 4  5

1 a b c d  e

2 f g h ij k

3 l m n o  p

4 q r s t  u

5 v w x y  z

Let's see an example.

If I take the string 'ab' I get '1112'

For simplicity we choose the international alphabet composed of 26 lowercase characters
