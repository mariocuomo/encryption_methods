# Caesar cipher

The Caesar cipher is a substitution encryption algorithm

Each letter is replaced with another at a fixed distance

Let's see an example.

If I take the string 'ab' and choose distance 3 I get 'de'

The code is cyclic, if I take the string 'yz' and choose distance 3 I get 'bc'

For simplicity we choose the international alphabet composed of 26 lowercase characters
